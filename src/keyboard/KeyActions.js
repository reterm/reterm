   * 'normal' action and the the keystroke represents a printable key, the
   * character will be sent to the host.  If used in one of the modifier
   * actions, the terminal will perform the normal action after (possibly)
   * altering it.
   *
   *  - If the normal sequence starts with CSI, the sequence will be adjusted
   *    to include the modifier parameter as described in [XTERM] in the final
   *    table of the "PC-Style Function Keys" section.
   *
   *  - If the control key is down and the key represents a printable character,
   *    and the uppercase version of the unshifted keycap is between
   *    64 (ASCII '@') and 95 (ASCII '_'), then the uppercase version of the
   *    unshifted keycap minus 64 is sent.  This makes '^@' send '\x00' and
   *    '^_' send '\x1f'.  (Note that one higher that 0x1f is 0x20, which is
   *    the first printable ASCII value.)
   *
   *  - If the alt key is down and the key represents a printable character then
   *    the value of the character is shifted up by 128.
   *
   *  - If meta is down and configured to send an escape, '\x1b' will be sent
   *    before the normal action is performed.
